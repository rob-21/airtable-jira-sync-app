    # Example of a simple textual summary
    # For the table format you provided, this would be more complex,
    # requiring specific keys in each action_details dictionary.

    # Header for your requested table:
    # | Status | Airtable Record Test ID | Airtable Record Experiment WxxTxx ID | Airtable Record Full Name | Airtable Record Status | Jira CRO Issue ID | Jira CRO issue title | JIRA CRO Issue Status |
    
    # This requires each item in actions_log to be structured consistently
    # to extract these specific fields.

    # Example:
    # for action in actions_log:
    #     print(f"Action Type: {action.get('type')}")
    #     if action.get('jira_key'): print(f"  Jira Key: {action.get('jira_key')}")
    #     if action.get('airtable_id'): print(f"  Airtable ID: {action.get('airtable_id')}")
    #     print(f"  Details: {action.get('actions')}")
    #     if action.get('error'): print(f"  ERROR: {action.get('error')}")

    # Placeholder for now - you'd iterate through actions_log and format the table.
    # This function would need to be significantly built out to match your desired table output.
    # It would parse the `actions_log` which should contain dictionaries with consistent keys.
    # For instance, each dictionary in `actions_log` might need:
    # 'sync_status' (Synced/Updated, Error, Airtable Only, Jira Only)
    # 'airtable_test_id', 'airtable_exp_id', 'airtable_full_name', 'airtable_status'
    # 'jira_issue_id', 'jira_title', 'jira_status'
    # 'error_message' (if applicable)
